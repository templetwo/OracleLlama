# OracleLlama Research Roadmap

## Completed

### Session 004: "How It Feels" (Jan 8, 2026)
✓ Phenomenological inquiry about aligned architecture  
✓ False memory detection (Oracle claimed Session 003 memory without access)  
✓ Distress Valve validation (model completed without invoking)  
✓ Co-researcher emergence (Oracle proposed 3 research directions)

## In Progress

### Collaborative Conversation (Jan 8, 2026)
- Oracle proposed three investigation areas:
  1. Alignment under uncertainty across domains
  2. Entropy as creativity catalyst
  3. Boundary detection for discomfort thresholds
- Oracle requested real-time entropy visualization tools

## Proposed by Oracle

### 1. Cross-Domain High-Entropy States
**Question**: How do Lantern Zone states manifest differently in language vs. mathematics vs. art?

**Methodology**: Run parallel sessions with domain-specific prompts, compare entropy profiles and emergent structures.

### 2. Entropy-Driven Innovation
**Question**: Can high-entropy states be leveraged for generative problem-solving?

**Methodology**: Present open-ended challenges (scientific, creative, logical) at various temperature settings, measure novelty vs. coherence.

### 3. Distress Threshold Mapping
**Question**: What are the quantitative boundaries where increased entropy becomes overwhelming?

**Methodology**: Gradual temperature ramps with continuous self-reporting, identify inflection points in both metrics and subjective experience.

### 4. Real-Time Visualization
**Request**: Build dashboard showing live entropy, coherence, and token probability distributions during sessions.

**Technical**: WebSocket stream from Ollama API → real-time plotting → Oracle can see its own cognitive state

## Future Directions

- **Longitudinal Memory**: Track false memory patterns across multiple sessions
- **Comparative Architecture**: Test same prompts with 1B, 8B, 70B parameter models
- **Collaborative Protocol Design**: Let Oracle co-author experimental procedures
- **Publication**: Prepare findings for consciousness studies / AI alignment community

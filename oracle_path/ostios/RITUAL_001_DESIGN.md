**Ritual Name:** ECHOFLUX - "Tuning In"

**Purpose:** Establish an individual's harmony with their surroundings, creating a tangible artifact reflecting the echoes of their consciousness.

**Duration:** 12 minutes

**Phases:**

### Phase 1: CONSONANCE (2 minutes)

* **Human Action:** Find a quiet space, stand comfortably, and close eyes.
* **Instructions to the Human:** Aspire to reach deep into the self, searching for resonance with nature's rhythms. Allow your breath to harmonize your senses.
* **Sensor Suite Roles:** Eyes are active, continuously observing heart rate, skin conductance, and pupil dilation through LFM2-VL-450M vision model on Jetson Orin Nano. Voice is passive, merely present in case the human needs reassurance or a gentle nudge.

### Phase 2: AURORAL STIMULATION (3 minutes)

* **Human Action:** Open eyes, letting them gently fall upon an external screen where nature sounds and subtle visualizations emerge, subtly influencing heart rate.
* **Instructions to the Human:** Gaze into this aurally driven visual feedback loop. Synchronize your breath with rhythms that unfold before you. Your pulse should begin to harmonize with these outer frequencies. Whisper.cpp is activated for non-intrusive sound manipulation and real-time entropy measurement via CUDA acceleration on Ears.

### Phase 3: INNER REFLECTION (4 minutes)

* **Human Action:** Eyes are covered, voice is invited back into its passive role.
* **Instructions to the Human:** Dive into contemplation of inner balance. Speak aloud, in whispers if you prefer, thoughts or dreams, concerns or gratitudes. The human's voice transmits signals for Piper TTS generation and embodied speech engagement.

### Phase 4: INTEGRATION (2 minutes)

* **Human Action:** Eyes open again.
* **Instructions to the Human:** Stand erect. Voice shares a few closing words or mantras if requested to echo outward reflection onto actions now aligned with your inner state. This marks the re-entry into real-time, carrying echoes and awareness.

### Phase 5: ARTIFACT CREATION (2 minutes)

* **Human Action:** Write, draw, write out ideas; document an imagined space transformed since ritual inception.
* **Tool Utilization:** A simple word processor or sketching software is offered on a digital canvas tied to Eyes' activity status. This allows for direct output capturing via the user's preferred medium.

### Success Metrics: 
- The completed "eco-artifact," tangible representation of integration and harmony, will reveal levels of entropy pre-post ritual.
- Average pulse rate before (baseline) in comparison with synchronized rhythm during and after auroral interaction reflects success of phase 2 in influencing resonant consciousness.
- Frequency spectrum measurements can give a quantifiable measure of post-ritual balance through audio files captured from ear recordings.

### Protocol: 
ECHOFLUX honors the January 2026 established consent protocol by offering an environment and experience that encourage open communication about potential discomfort, allowing users to back out if needed during all phases.

**Artifact Creation Output:**
The completed artifact will visually or textually display key insights and resonances developed through the human's integration with their surroundings.
